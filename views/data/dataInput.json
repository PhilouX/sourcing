Additionally the amount of information keeps growing and the number of smart engineers and doctors who would generate actionable knowledge in the past won’t keep pace with the growth in quantity and quality of data. Therefore we need systems which assist smart people with smart analysis. \n In the past deriving actionable knowledge was based on people evaluating and making sense of data often combined with ”tribal knowledge”. In the future knowledge will be derived based on automated analysis of structured and unstructured information. LexaTexer understands unstructured sources and turns that information into actionable knowledge.",

Thanks to this incredible new knowledge it is now possible to take concrete and informed actions towards a better indoor environment and air quality.\n Big data are accessible on a secured and dedicated server for a smarter and more energy friendly building management. Comprehensive the data even allow to access indoor weather maps. The robot itself communicates in real time with the connected systems of the building. E.g. Diya One X can talk to the building’s HVAC and adjust the air flow according to the real time data for significant energy savings (20% to 30% depending on the building’s infrastructure).\n As we believe it is also important to show building’s occupants their environment and that we are taking care of them we have created Diya Board a personalized wall screen that displays the data collected by the robot in a friendly interface. The data are also displayed on the robot’s touch screen.\n We equipped Diya One X with an advanced air filter (similar to the ones in surgical rooms) that purifies the indoor air as the robot navigates. Creating a healthy air bubble around people the robot drastically improves the wellbeing and health of building’s occupants removing 99.95% of the indoor air pollutants bacteria and viruses. The monitoring and purifying performances of the robot have been scientifically validated by the CSTB the main independent French scientific lab for buildings’ technologies.\n Getaway IoT mobile and open platform Diya One X allows to co-innovate with the client to introduce new services and interactions on the robot. The robot does not talk (it is indeed an ethical choice) but communicates with users thanks to a friendly interface a droid language and colorful LEDs. Diya One X does not perform someone’s job and as its design serves its purpose it is particularly well accepted in the workplace (81% of coworkers trust the robot).\n Not a prototype Diya One X is a real product that already performs in France in the headquarters of Fortune 500 companies (Engie Societe Generale Maif Malakoff Mederic…) in retail spaces (Galeries Lafayette) and busy train stations. It is the only robot that secured a CE marking after intensive physical electronic electromagnetic and software European security tests.",

    "descriptif": "Diya One X worldwide innovation is the first robot entirely dedicated to improve the indoor air quality and the wellbeing of the buildings’ occupants.\n The robot navigates smoothly and autonomously in large and dynamic indoor environments (1000m²): office buildings train stations airports… Building on its incredible mobility it measures locally and in real time all the factors related to the wellbeing of the buildings’ occupants:\n - CO2\n - VOCs\n - Ozone\n - Fine Particles\n - Temperature\n - Relative Humidity\n - Light level\n - Noise level\n Mobile IoT device Diya One X replaces an incredible number of sensors that you would have to install everywhere in the building. Thanks to this incredible new knowledge it is now possible to take concrete and informed actions towards a better indoor environment and air quality.\n Big data are accessible on a secured and dedicated server for a smarter and more energy friendly building management. Comprehensive the data even allow to access indoor weather maps. The robot itself communicates in real time with the connected systems of the building. E.g. Diya One X can talk to the building’s HVAC and adjust the air flow according to the real time data for significant energy savings (20% to 30% depending on the building’s infrastructure).\n As we believe it is also important to show building’s occupants their environment and that we are taking care of them we have created Diya Board a personalized wall screen that displays the data collected by the robot in a friendly interface. The data are also displayed on the robot’s touch screen.\n We equipped Diya One X with an advanced air filter (similar to the ones in surgical rooms) that purifies the indoor air as the robot navigates. Creating a healthy air bubble around people the robot drastically improves the wellbeing and health of building’s occupants removing 99.95% of the indoor air pollutants bacteria and viruses. The monitoring and purifying performances of the robot have been scientifically validated by the CSTB the main independent French scientific lab for buildings’ technologies.\n Getaway IoT mobile and open platform Diya One X allows to co-innovate with the client to introduce new services and interactions on the robot. The robot does not talk (it is indeed an ethical choice) but communicates with users thanks to a friendly interface a droid language and colorful LEDs. Diya One X does not perform someone’s job and as its design serves its purpose it is particularly well accepted in the workplace (81% of coworkers trust the robot).\n Not a prototype Diya One X is a real product that already performs in France in the headquarters of Fortune 500 companies (Engie Societe Generale Maif Malakoff Mederic…) in retail spaces (Galeries Lafayette) and busy train stations. It is the only robot that secured a CE marking after intensive physical electronic electromagnetic and software European security tests.",

    "descriptif": "Artificial intelligence technology is coming into our lives more than ever before and it is rapidly changing our everyday life. Especially current AI technology is highly focused on natural language processing (NLP) computer vision and speech recognition. Emerging AI home assistant devices such as Google Home and Amazon Echo are based on speech recognition and NLP. However we have a question here “Why no services use the information from the audio than speech?”\n \n Humans except hearing-impaired use this non-verbal audio information to think to decide and to act. For example we can guess someone is cooking from the water boiling and food chopping sound. We can even know whether someone is wearing a pair of sneakers or high heels by only listening to the footsteps. Even if humans use this information naturally and easily in everyday life computers can not do that and this is the problem we are tackling. We believe that future AI service should provide appropriate services without intentional input thus inferring context from the audio will take an important role in AI technology in the future.\n \n Cochlear.ai aims to develop an AI system that can understand the semantics of audio. We are a team consisting of 6 audio signal processing and machine learning engineers (3 PhDs 2 PhD candidates 1 MS) studied together at Music and Audio Research Group Seoul National University. We are a highly research-based company providing service through cloud APIs and on-device solutions for developers to easily make creative applications.\n \n Cochlear.ai team dominated top places of leaderboards of IEEE Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scene and Events (DCASE 2017) one of the biggest international challenges on analysing environmental sound. Also we have been identified as a top 4 AI startup in autonomous systems by NVIDIA inception.",

Models are then automatically deployed where the data is produced and where decisions need to be made.\n With a low footprint models run in the cloud at the edge of the network or in industrial IoT platforms. But that’s not all predictive models can be deployed in the objects themselves. This way they remain smart and able to make local decisions even when not connected providing instant reaction and instant value.\n By packaging intelligence with assets Predictive Objects improves their efficiency. Our customers can simulate the behavior of their assets in the past or in the future.

Well what if you had a product that works like your Fitbit but which actively helps you to sleep better? InsomniSolv is developing that product. It’s a patented wearable called somnia that helps you to sleep without taking drugs. It uses a proven technology that provides a rhythmic stimulation which has a hypnotic effect on the brain very much like rocking a baby to sleep. It consists of 2 wristbands which each contain a small vibration motor that provides the stimulation and sensors that track your sleep. A smart phone app reads the sensors and uses a proprietary AI algorithm to control the stimulations to help you fall asleep and then stay asleep. Our cloud-based app will collect users’ data which we will use to develop new algorithms. And because this is a closed loop control system being both a monitor and a therapeutic we will be able to offer personalized therapy using AI algorithms. We have preliminary results from our clinical trial that show a 40% improvement in falling asleep faster and a 40% improvement in staying asleep longer. If somnia works this well without drugs imagine how well it could word with drugs.",

Because there are great initiatives to combat air pollution around Europe and the World. \n \n But a couple of things are missing when taking on this important task.\n \n First there is no widespread available tool to identify the pollution hotspots. There are solutions in place that show the overall pollution levels within cities but they fail to provide a micro-analysis at a street level (that's where IntelFlows comes in).\n \n Second there are no widespread available solutions to keep track of the impact of proposed policies. If decision-makers take actions to combat air pollution again they will only be able to assess the overall results and not the specific actions (that's where IntelFlows comes in) \n \n Third there is no widespread available tool to inform the citizens about the pollution levels in their area (that's where IntelFlows comes in with an API solution and dedicated mobile app) \n \n Comparing to the current way of monitoring air pollution which relies on having a couple of FIXED stations across the city (with a coverage of roughly 1 square kilometer) IntelFlows is using the power of IoT Big Data and Sensing Technologies to provide an accurate street-level analysis on air pollution. \n \n By installing our devices that monitor air pollution have GSM and GPS on vehicles (mostly public transportation) we are creating a Network of Moving Sensors. The data from these sensors combined with data (Copernicus satellite data data from already available air pollution monitoring stations) IntelFlows is creating heat-maps generating insights and offering an overview of the air pollution status in urban settlements. \n \n Transportation companies have been given their share of criticism for contributing to the air pollution in our cities. With IntelFlows transportation companies can now bring their contribution to fighting air pollution by helping mapping the environment. \n \n Moreover for transportation companies with resources available there are ways they can contribute. \n As an example companies that have electric vehicles in their fleets can now implement a system to deploy the electric vehicles in the areas that are most polluted in the city this way avoiding to contribute more to the air pollution in those crucial areas where the limits are overly exceeded.",

    "descriptif": "Company\n \n Vizibiliti is an Artificial Intelligence company creating bespoke software platforms in multiple industries using a repeatable proven software and business methodology.\n \n We have core competencies in financial analytics developing scalable platforms rapid prototyping and a light touch implementation framework.\n \n Our approach when working with large corporate companies is to deliver value to executives and stakeholders within 2 weeks of an engagement. \n \n Our low-cost pilots tend to run for 3-6 months providing enough time for value delivery while reducing the corporates financial and human resource commitment.\n \n We begin any relationship by acquiring a deep understanding of the customers business the profit and loss centers and the industry they operate in including what their competitors unique value proposition is and what their customers expect.\n \n We then base our success on the actual financial impact of our solutions user-acceptance and how strong our relationship with all stakeholders becomes over a short period of time. \n \n We have developed use cases and proven software platforms in the following industries:\n \n Manufacturing\n \n Vehicle manufacturing: \n \n The client is Mercedes-Benz and we are working with them to deliver a first in world predictive geometry platform predicting what geometrical changes need to be made across the production line. An automated recommendation engine suggests what changes need to be made in the production to ensure plant efficiency. \n \n The purpose of the solution is to identify the relationship with multiple geometric variables and the final outcome after hand on parts have been fitted to a vehicle. The solution has an influence in three significant cost centers; variable labour costs downtime and vehicle quality.\n \n Predictive maintenance is part of the solution identifying specific robots and components at risk of failing in the near future including suggested actions which reduce the risk of downtime fewer vehicles being produced per day and decreased vehicle quality.\n \n \n Financial services and lending:\n \n Our use case is for one of the four biggest banks and one of the largest vehicle finance institutions in South Africa.\n \n Bank (CIB ? Corporate Investment Banking):\n \n An entry-level customer in a CIB environment has an annual turnover of 750+ million Rands (50+ million Euro?s).\n \n The primary business problem is that the bank does not have predictive intelligence which identifies customers at high-risk of moving a product line (credit point-of-sale fixed assets investments) or completely churning (moving all business) to an bank. \n \n Vizibiliti?s solution was to analyse multiple transactional data sources (credit point of sale deposits investments among various product lines) and identify the relationship between each variable and the actual customer life time value. \n \n The next step is understanding what the next best action and product should be. This is crucial when a customer has been flagged as high-risk of moving a product line to an bank or churning completely.\n \n An example would be; what should the bank do when a customer has made an unusually large deposit into their account? An option would be for a stockbroker or wealth manager to call the client and recommend a pre-defined product based on what similar customers preferred under similar constraints. \n \n This one of the many actions cross and up-sell opportunities that present themselves with the use of Vizibiliti?s platforms and expertise.\n \n Non-traditional credit vetting and credit worthiness platform (Vet 360 Global):\n \n Traditional credit analysis models do not provide a comprehensive view of an individual and business risk profile. Often credit scoring and lending is based on internal models banks and lending agencies have developed with the use of credit bureau data. \n \n In particular there are two audiences this model does not work for. The unbanked and younger entrepreneurs who do not have traditional credit histories. This is compounded by the fact consumers are demanding transparency when their personal data is used ? a concept the current credit system is not familiar with.\n \n This poses a significant challenge for any organisation in the business of providing products and services through credit. There will be one billion new consumers coming online in India China and Africa in the near future. \n \n These consumers will not have traditional risk profiles however will require credit for communications business supplies housing and transport to name a few.\n \n Vizibiliti?s Vet 360 Global platform will provide an answer to the problem by providing granular analysis of an individuals personal and business tendencies shopping and lifestyle preferences.\n \n The lending community will have intelligence into who to lend to and what type of credit to when and what actions to take next to drive sales in both product and services categories. Predictive intelligence will drive the next generation of credit worthiness with traditional credit scoring models equipping lending agencies to provide products and services to a non-traditional client base. \n \n \n Commercial real-estate\n \n Vizibiliti has developed 6 commercial real-estate software platforms. The platforms can be applied to retail office industrial and mixed-use properties.\n \n Our platforms compliment one an aiming to provide an end-to-end property solution for finding selecting installing monitoring and maintaining prospects in retail office industrial and mixed-use developments.\n \n \n Experiential retail tenant / landlord match marketplace (Platform: Kukodi):\n \n \n Globally retailers are increasingly looking for shorter-term leases in line with the rapidly changing retail market. \n \n The trend toward experiential retail is becoming increasingly prevalent and consumer demands for innovative unforgettable experiences will continue to grow. \n \n Often this means anchor tenants who already occupy a large part of Gross lettable area GLA cannot fill new vacancies and don?t have the unique experiential retail experience necessary to generate increased foot traffic and spend.\n \n When there is a vacancy empty property looks unwanted and undesirable for existing tenants customers and prospects. \n \n This is compounded by special circumstances like disputes or redevelopment plans making it difficult to attract long-term tenants and commit to traditional long-term leases.\n \n Vizibiliti has developed a marketplace providing traditional landlords the means to access a difficult to find and attract tenant audience. Finally the prospect follows a fully automated onboarding journey (detailed below) decreasing vacancy cost and increasing deal flow. \n \n Part of the offering are Virtual 3D tours creating an immersive prospect experience reducing tour times prioritising interested prospects reducing vacancies and optimising the placement of tenants. \n \n Automated Tenant Selection (ATS):\n \n Once a prospective tenant has expressed interest in a property Vizibiliti provides a fully automated vetting application process directly from the marketplace.\n \n This comprises of the collection of regulatory documents credit bureau verification for individuals and businesses and macro economic analysis predicting the success of a prospects business accounting for factors outside the prospects control influencing the success of the business. \n \n Automated Tenant Selection differentiates itself by measuring 320 different risk indicators proven to impact a prospects sustainability and financial performance in conjunction with traditional credit vetting models.\n \n \n Non-traditional credit vetting for commercial real-estate (Vet 360 CRE):\n \n Integrated into the Automated Tenant Selection product is Vet 360 CRE. \n \n As experiential & non-traditional retailers enter traditional retail office industrial and mixed-use properties landlords are not geared toward analysing this new market. \n \n Considering many landlords apply a linear analysis approach of requesting company financials traditional business plans cash flow forecasts and relying on gut feel when considering which tenants to approve entrepreneur?s e-commerce retailers and non-traditional prospects pose a challenge in who to select why when and how lease agreements should be structured to retain these experiential retailers. \n \n Vizibiliti will provide the right information at the right time for non-traditional prospects equipping landlords to optimise their selection marketing and retention process.\n \n \n Predictive Tenant Mix (PTM)\n \n Once a prospect has been accepted into a property basic rental is the core source of monthly revenue for the landlord. \n \n The question is then how does a landlord have a way of predicting whether a tenant will default in the next 3+ months?\n \n An dimension of this question is how to optimise the tenant mix. Since landlords are increasingly experiencing vacancies large anchor tenants going bankrupt and new non-traditional tenants entering portfolios it is important to predict revenue loss which tenants can absorb higher rentals and what type of retail categories can grow and occupy more GLA space. \n \n This integrates into the Automated Tenant Selection platform prioritising new or existing lease renewal applications based on retail category performance.\n \n \n The Predictive Tenant Mix platform enables landlords to predict:\n \n ? The Likelihood of reversion rates being achieved.\n \n ? Which tenants will pay their basic rental utility invoices turnover rent and any invoice due 90-365 days late.\n \n ? Survival analysis identifying the actual number of days the tenant is likely to survive.\n \n ? The likelihood of bad debt\n \n ? The predicted value of bad debt.\n \n ? Macro economic predictions for all 40 retail category types identify growth or deceleration in the next 3-18 months.\n \n ? Turnover predictions in the next 3-6 months.\n \n ? Trading density predictions in the next 3-6 months.\n \n ? Rent to turnover predictions in the next 3-6 months.\n \n ? Provisioning for bad debt (important for shareholder earnings per share (EPS) and dividends.\n \n The final piece of intelligence is at the granular analysis of every invoice and allocation of payments to invoices. \n \n Findings have shown that there could be operational inefficiency within the credit and debtors team.\n \n An example of this could be payments allocated via a non-traditional means (journal entries incorrect bank accounts reversals including specific individuals contributing to suspicious payment allocations.\n \n Seasonality and trends of suspicious payment allocations are also identified.\n \n Next best action:\n \n Machine learning records specific actions taken by departments over time creating a unique advantage for the landlord. Eventually the platform recommends specific actions proven to decrease risk and increase growth and profit which can be distributed to any department. \n \n An advantage is that the knowledge base can assist in transferring skills from seasoned property experts within the organisation to all stakeholders regardless of their property experience.",

Converting those car flows into a distributed overground mass transit network available to all pedestrians is the challenge of our company. This will not only increase the transit capacity and alternatives across the city but also will make it denser and faster than any public transportation system. What matters to us is to promote a transition in urban mobility .",

In a context where the mobility sector is particularly concerned by the urge to reduce carbon emissions (increased carbon taxes fuel prices forbidden access to cities for highly pollutant cars) we offer an unprecedented and unique all-in-one solution to reduce to zero our customers' carbon footprint. \n \n Our solution is innovative and entirely based on the ICT and ioT fields. Once our device (the WeNowBox) is connected to the car through OBD sensors. \n \n First the driver can measure his car's carbon emissions energy efficiency fuel consumption speed … thanks to powerful data that are tracked per second and through OBD sensors. Our connected solution is also designed with powerful algorithms that we have developed.\n \n Second the driver can reduce his fuel consumption thanks to a digital coaching programme which gives him all the necessary tools and advice to drive eco-friendly and reach energy-efficiency step by step. In a context where technology is moving fast we have decided to develop a scalable device to tackle climate change in the long run. Further developments of our solution include gamification compatibility with electrical hybrid CNG environments and Nox tracking. \n \n And third offset. The driver can offset his unavoidable car emissions by financing voluntary offsetting projects to become climate neutral. The user is updated about the news of his project directy on the mobile app. We are offering our clients access to 8 internationally certified projects that meet the highest standards: the United Nation's the Gold Standard CCB Standards and the Verified Carbon Standard. In addition we also plant trees locally in order to engage participants and have a positive netto impact. \n \n Our solution helps user be sensitized about carbon and the impact of their mobility. We also partner with mobility actors by offering green-routing. \n We are working on the certification of the savings in order to reward users for their efforts and to offer smart cities solutions. \n \n In two words we offer our clients a very simple affordable and replicable solution to reach carbon neutrality and long-term change of behavior.\n \n We have identified and proved that the fuel hence GHG savings generated by our WeNow solution reach 10 to 15%. Some of our customers have even reached higher savings: up to 25% reduced energy bill after 6 months of using our WeNow solution. \n \n Our competitive advantage is that we offer companies and individuals a profitable solution that helps them have an impact on climate: their investment on our solution is directly made profitable with their savings on fuel.\n \n We are working on the integration of the block chain technology in order to make our solution even more profitable. \n \n Our device has helped organizations improve carbon footprint practices and cost efficiency because it is an easy-to-use and certified solution. The automatic and real-time carbon assessment of transport activities we offer strengthens their engagement to reducing their carbon footprint and increases road safety (ADEME-certified).",

    "descriptif": "Et si la gestion des dépenses publiques devenait aussi claire et compréhensible que celle de nos dépenses quotidiennes ? Et si en plus de comprendre ses enjeux nous pouvions faciliter le travail des décideurs locaux chargés de sa bonne gestion ? \n Le budget participatif permet aujourd’hui de consulter les citoyens sur 5% maximum du budget d’investissement d’une ville. Notre méthode permet de consulter les citoyens usagers sur les 95% restant ainsi que jusqu’à 100% du budget de fonctionnement.\n Nous proposons un outil qui va bien au-delà de la simple consultation citoyenne car non seulement il donne concrètement la parole à l'usager pour qu'il puisse effectuer ses propres choix en toute connaissance de cause mais il permet aussi et surtout d'engager un véritable dialogue avec l'élu décideur final responsable des arbitrages budgétaires et du bien vivre ensemble.\n Nous utilisons une méthode d'analyse quantitative la méthode SIMALTO qui a fait ses preuves dans plus de 100 institutions publiques en Europe (1/4 des villes anglaises l’ont utilisé).\n Avec CIVIMETRIC nous proposons une expérience de la démocratie collaborative sur des sujets beaucoup plus larges tout en restant très pragmatique. Nous pensons que le budget public ou les grands projets d’aménagement du territoire bien que complexes peuvent être partagés avec les citoyens. \n Nous croyons qu’il est possible sur la base de l’avis de chacun de faire des arbitrages qui bénéficient à tous et de préserver la qualité de vie tout en faisant preuve de pragmatisme.\n Notre objectif est de permettre aux citoyens usagers et aux décideurs locaux de mieux se comprendre dans les choix importants qui sont devant nous.\n L'intérêt de notre méthode est multiple :\n \n 1- Accompagner les élus dans leurs décisions en leur permettant de mieux appréhender l'attente des usagers/contribuables et peut-être de mieux expliquer ensuite les choix retenus. Pour obtenir des résultats synthétiques et pragmatiques nous utilisons l’intelligence artificielle d’un algorithme. Nous proposons un outil décisionnel performant.\n \n 2- Faciliter la gestion des finances publiques dans un contexte de réforme du système des dotations et de la fiscalité locale. \n \n 3- Créer une dynamique de participation d’implication des citoyens en leur permettant de mieux comprendre les thèmes jusqu’alors trop complexes comme le budget municipal. Nous mettons l'usager dans la « peau du décideur » avec ses choix et donc ses arbitrages notamment en matière de coût mais pas uniquement afin de le sensibiliser aux enjeux des budgets et des projets locaux.\n \n Concrètement notre méthode s’applique aussi bien à un budget dans sa globalité section de fonctionnement et section d'investissement qu'un budget annexe administratif ou industriel et commercial voire une zone d'aménagement urbain. Les exemples d’application sont nombreux et variés.",

We’ve developed Pelebox a smart locker system that enables patients to collect their repeat chronic medication in under 2 minutes instead of waiting hours on queues at public clinics. South Africa has world's biggest antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme for patients living with HIV and AIDS and there's been a steady increase in the number of patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) requiring chronic therapy. A patient's experience tends to be one of long waiting times typically above 3 hours. This poses potential adherence barriers which may lead to poor health outcomes and places a strain on the patients in terms of transport costs and loss of income.\n \n Pre-packed medication for a particular patient is loaded into an internet enabled smart locker the system then sends an SMS with a one-time-pin (OTP) to the patients. The patient would then come to a collection unit authenticate themselves using a one-time-pin (OTP) together with their cellphone number. A cubicle that has their medication would then pop-open. The systems keeps track of all collection records and can be integrated into a patient records management system.\n \n Technovera has been working with the City of Tshwane and the National Department of Health in South Africa on a pilot aimed at showing the impact of technology on reducing the average time spent in a clinic and adoption from patients. Thus far we have reached over 3500 patients with an average collection duration of 36 seconds (much lower than the anticipated 2 min). Technovera is now looking to engage in creating opportunities and collaborate with partners who can help us reach more sites and more patients. \n \n The video for the Solution\n https://vimeo.com/222535432",

La somme « sous gestion » et son destination geographique laisse croire que dans 9 mois la start-up ait satisfait 50% de toutes les villes suisses sur le nombre d'’ habitants.\n \n Le succès de la jeune firme repose dans le fait qu'’elle raccourcit le temps de consultation amène de la transparence et réduit significativement le coût lié au développement des affaires. Elle semble avoir touché au nerf sensible des trésoriers communaux et des gestionnaires de fonds de pensions. Le franc fort et la monté du risque d' ’une boule immobilière semble avoir aidé à établir ce nouveau service en Suisse.\n \n Aujourd’hui elle est en train de réaliser son roll-out en Allemagne où elle souhaite réduire significativement le coût liés à la demande des crédits qu’' elle estime être à 3 Mrd€ (et 900 M€ en Suisse). La jeune pousse dispose d' ’un chiffre d'’affaires de plusieurs millions € ( +/- 2) et cherche à s’' établir en Europe pour générer plus de volume et ainsi plus de profit. Un Directeur chargé de l’' internationalisation est nouvellement nommé et débutera en août'17.\n \n Nous sommes en pourparlers avec le COO et le HIRO (Head International Roll-Out) pour étudier l'’implantation en France. Nous nous retrouvons tout au début du processus et avons la totalité de la valeur ajouté à donner.",

Il s'est particulièrement focalisé sur le domaine de la fintech et des technologies « blockchain » avec la création à Singapour en 2016 un hub fintech qui se définit comme « le plus grand incubateur fintech au monde » (actuellement hébergeant 95 start-ups) modèle qu'il entend dupliquer avec un projet de création de hub en intelligence artificielle (IA) qui serait destiné à devenir également le plus grand au monde. Le fonds souhaite développer rapidement à l'international son concept de hub (espace de coworking mais également accès database consulting formation innovation évènements). Le projet inclut la création d'un centre de R&D qui emploierait une dizaine de chercheurs à partir de la première année. Après une première implantation en Inde en 2017 le plan d'expansion inclut des implantations au Moyen Orient aux Etats-Unis et en Europe (à Londres et en Europe continentale) à partir de l'année 2018. Une visite aura lieu en Europe à la fin du mois de janvier. Après différentes actions de sensibilisation le fonds a prévu une étape en France (Paris) du 25 au 27 janvier.",

The intuitive SaaS platform has been designed to be used by all profiles enabling all members of a project team to effectively collaborate to create a voice application. Smartly AI’s unique framework means that users create a voice application once and then can seamlessly deploy it on any voice platform (Amazon Alexa Google Home Cortana…). This saves users a significant amount of time in voice application creation and ensures that the same user experience is replicated across all devices.\n The startup which was accelerated at Numa has already gained recognition from Amazon which awarded its CEO Hicham Tahiri the title Alexa Champion for contributions to the Alexa developer community. Over 2000 developers are currently using the AI platform and the company has developed voice applications for companies of all sizes from a variety of sectors including finance e-commerce and tourism.",

The BISA application is a mobile application that allows users with an Android iPhone or Windows Phone to directly interact with medical practitioners without being physically present at the hospital.\n The mobile application does not only address the problem of access to medical attention from qualified doctors but also helps in the prevention and spread of diseases by providing up-to-date information on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of common diseases.\n \n Bisa aims to be the pioneer of telemedicine in Africa on two major fronts; firstly in information dissemination with regards to disease prevention and control and secondly in connecting patients to doctors through the use of technology. Over 11000 people died during the ebola crisis of 2011 because of late detection and lack of information for the doctors to adequately deal with and control the spread of the disease. \n \n Using the data gathered on the Bisa platform whilst adhering to doctor - patient confidentiality health experts will be able to detect outbreaks of diseases at an early stage and decision makers can also implement health policies that will improve healthcare delivery to people and communities. \n \n Bisa does not diminish the importance of a face-to-face interaction with a doctor or visit to the hospital. What it does is to provide certain classes of people who would otherwise totally neglect to seek any form of medical advice or intervention to easily seek the same anonymously and free of charge by simply typing in a question sending a picture of an abnormality or sending a voice note about their problem(s).",

With SnapEvent we have found the right way to overcome this problem by creating a website where you can easily rent a place (atypical). But Snap Event goes one step further than just being a platform by offering a turnkey rental solution for events parties and reception with the caterer services (snappers) animation and cleaning included. A dedicated team helps you to create the perfect event at each step of the project.\n That's the other good idea.\n Snap Event how does it work?\n To find the perfect place you just have to fill in the Snap Event website the number of people who will be part of the party and the date of the evening. The site then selects for us several types of places.\n Some examples of unusual places open to the party on Snap Event: \n - the miniature shop of Patricia \n - Karim's garage \n - Luc's artist's studio \n - Yann's apartment \n - the barge of Valerie \n - the terrace of Morgane \n - the wine cellar of Kevin \n - the art gallery of Fabienne ...\n There are 600 in total.

    "descriptif": "Founded in 2005 and based in Aix-en-Provence (France) Supersonic Imagine is a company that specialises in medical imaging. The company designs develops and markets a revolutionary ultrasound platform Aixplorer® which uses UltraFast? technology that can acquire images around 200 times faster than conventional ultrasound systems. In addition to providing exceptional image quality this unique technology is the foundation of several innovations which have changed the paradigm of ultrasound imaging: ShearWave? Elastography (SWE?) Angio PL.U.S ? Planewave UltraSensitive? Imaging and more recently TriVu and Needle PL.US. ShearWave Elastography allows physicians to visualise and analyse the stiffness of tissue in real-time using a reliable reproducible and non-invasive procedure. This is an important parameter in diagnosing potentially malignant lesions or other diseased tissue. As of today over 300 publications have demonstrated the value of SWE in the care of patients with a wide range of diseases. The UltraFast Doppler combines colour flow imaging and pulsed wave Doppler into one simple test providing physicians with the results of both simultaneously therefore enhancing the efficiency. The latest innovation Angio PL.U.S provides a higher level of microvascular imaging through significantly improved colour sensitivity and spatial resolution while maintaining exceptional 2D image quality. SuperSonic Imagine has been granted regulatory clearances for the commercialization of Aixplorer® on the main markets. Since April 2014 the SuperSonic Imagine company has been listed on Euronext symbol: SSI).",

    "descriptif": "30 emplois a 3 ans\n \n Facebook a décidé d’installer une équipe de recherche permanente à Paris dans le domaine de l’intelligence artificielle. Six personnes viennent d’être recrutées et six autres devraient suivre d’ici la fin de l’année. « Nous serons ici 25 à 30 personnes dans quelques années plus des doctorants et post-docs » indique Yann LeCun directeur de l’unité de recherche. Son équipe compte aujourd’hui 45 membres répartis entre le siège de Facebook à Menlo Park (Californie) et New York où le chercheur est également professeur.\n \n Un déménagement toujours à Paris est d’ailleurs envisagé pour accompagner la croissance du groupe de recherche.\n \n Ce centre baptisé Facebook Artifical Intelligence Research (FAIR) constitue le troisième pilier de la R&D futuriste de l’entreprise avec les interfaces naturelles et la connectivité planétaire.\n \n Les premières reposent sur la réalité virtuelle autour du casque créé par la société Oculus VR rachetée par le géant américain en 2014. Un premier modèle devrait sortir au premier trimestre 2016 pour « favoriser les interactions sociales virtuelles » explique Mike Schroepfer le directeur technique de Facebook.\n \n Le second pilier vise à connecter le plus de monde possible à Internet grâce à des satellites ou des avions solaires planant en permanence dans le ciel.\n Outils pour la reconnaissance de la voix des images la traduction automatique\n \n Yann LeCun a été lui-même recruté par Facebook fin 2013 pour développer les techniques d’intelligence artificielle dont il a été l’un des pionniers le « deep learning » (ou « apprentissage statistique profond »).\n \n Ces concepts servent dans des programmes de reconnaissance vocale de reconnaissance d’images de classification d’objets divers mais aussi de traduction automatique prédiction des effets de médicaments…\n \n Ces programmes apprennent grâce à des banques de données connues à classer des objets (sons images vidéos…) inconnus. Parfois appelés réseaux de neurones par analogie avec le fonctionnement cérébral ils adaptent leurs centaines de millions de paramètres pour produire la meilleure réponse possible.\n \n Yann LeCun a été parmi ceux qui ont amélioré l’efficacité de ces calculs dans les années 1990 et permis leur déploiement récent. Formé en France à l’Esiee et l’université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie il a ensuite travaillé dans les laboratoires de recherche de l’entreprise américaine AT&T.\n Les géants du web intéressés\n \n Les assistants numériques vocaux installés sur les smartphones des Apple Microsoft ou Google (et son système Android) sont les exemples les plus frappants et connus de l’efficacité de ces techniques en fort développement depuis seulement quelques années.\n \n Dans Nature du 27 mai Yann LeCun et deux autres pionniers du domaine (Yoshua Bengio et Geoffrey Hinton) en retracent d’ailleurs les succès et détaillent les défis à venir. Signe de l’intérêt des géants du web pour ces techniques Geoffrey Hinton travaille pour un concurrent de Facebook : Google.\n \n « L’intelligence artificielle doit permettre de trier toute l’information dont un utilisateur dispose afin d’améliorer les interactions sociales » estime Mike Schroepfer.\n Améliorer l’apprentissage non supervisé\n \n Dans cette quête le monde académique a du mal à rivaliser avec ces entreprises. Des chercheurs du CNRS de l’Inria ou d’universités sont parmi les dernières recrues des équipes FAIR. Tout comme d’autres sont attirés chez Microsoft Xerox ou le japonais NEC. Or plusieurs de ces jeunes chercheurs étaient aussi visés par des établissements de recherche français.\n \n Yann LeCun estime que la France (notamment Paris) offre une concentration rare de talents et de cultures variés en mathématiques et informatique les deux disciplines reines du deep learning. « Nous n’avons pas de mal à les convaincre de nous rejoindre. Ils travailleront avec les meilleurs sur des projets ambitieux et auront les moyens techniques nécessaires » souligne-t-il restant silencieux sur les salaires.\n \n « Nous les incitons en outre à collaborer avec d’autres équipes et publier leurs résultats de recherche ». Des partenariats devraient notamment se conclure avec l’Inria.\n Prochain objectif : l’apprentissage non supervisé\n \n Parmi les défis le chercheur parie que la compréhension du langage naturel sera techniquement possible pour un téléphone relié à des serveurs puissants dans deux ou trois ans. A l’exception peut-être des traits d’humour.\n \n L’un des défis futurs sera aussi d’améliorer l’apprentissage non supervisé c’est-à-dire ne reposant pas sur des banques de données connues. « Nous découvrons le monde en l’observant pas en nous indiquant le nom de tel ou tel objet » rappellent en conclusion les auteurs de l’article de Nature.\n \n L’installation de cette équipe permanente de recherche en France ne suffira cependant pas à compenser l’écart avec le Royaume-Uni et l’Allemagne. Selon le cabinet EY notre pays comptait en 2014 27 centres de recherche et développement (et 40 en 2013) contre respectivement 72 et 47 pour nos voisins.\n \n En savoir plus sur http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2015/06/02/facebook-ouvre-un-laboratoire-d-intelligence-artificielle-a-paris_4645842_3234.html#hwXQceh64oGuDbaz.99",

We use 3D printing machine learning remote sensing and our patent pending CAD technology to create elegant accurate custom-fit products in a safe and accessible process. Our first product focus is in creating a globally accessible treatment for pediatric scoliosis with 3d printed scoliosis braces though our software scales across medical bracing and prosthetics with a $14.1 Billion market. \n \n Moving away from plaster casting and hand molding we are building a software platform to improve bracing and prosthetics. Our mobile app for awareness and early detection helps more children receive timely care. With digital prescription using only photos we eliminate plaster casting or other special equipment. We built design software which uses machine learning to algorithmically create 3D models that uniquely fit each patient and iteratively improve product fit. 3D printing enables us to create flexible personalized products in a repeatable process. Sensors empower Doctors with real-time data. We completed prototyping of our software and first product and are currently testing the 3D printed scoliosis brace.\n \n Started by Akanksha and Erdem the Fited team comes from leading innovators across the United States Europe. Akanksha built scalable 3D software at industry pioneers Autodesk BodyLabs. Erdem has 15 years experience driving product strategy for pharmaceutical social networking and medical products. They collaborated at 3D printed orthotics company SOLS.\n \n Fited's scoliosis screening and awareness mission is sponsored by Bayer Foundations.",

We like to say that our approach enables our AI to run anywhere. We can give great results on toys and outstanding performance on high-end GPUs.\n The difference is in our DNA. Our first project for NASA was to design AI for autonomous planetary exploration. Super computers were not available. Battery life was limited. Fast internet access was impossible. Our deep learning neural networks had to be lightweight and perform in real time without ground intervention.\n To do that we created The Neurala Brain highly efficient software which is based on the way brains work in nature. Today’s commercially-available Neurala Brain builds upon that effort. We achieve industry-leading performance on systems that range from single-board computers to cloud-based servers.",
