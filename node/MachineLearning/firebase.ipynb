It’s a patented wearable called somnia that helps you to sleep without taking drugs. It uses a proven technology that provides a rhythmic stimulation which has a hypnotic effect on the brain very much like rocking a baby to sleep. It consists of 2 wristbands which each contain a small vibration motor that provides the stimulation and sensors that track your sleep. A smart phone app reads the sensors and uses a proprietary AI algorithm to control the stimulations to help you fall asleep and then stay asleep. Our cloud-based app will collect users’ data which we will use to develop new algorithms. And because this is a closed loop control system being both a monitor and a therapeutic we will be able to offer personalized therapy using AI algorithms. We have preliminary results from our clinical trial that show a 40% improvement in falling asleep faster and a 40% improvement in staying asleep longer. If somnia works this well without drugs imagine how well it could word with drugs.\n",

      " Comparing to the current way of monitoring air pollution which relies on having a couple of FIXED stations across the city (with a coverage of roughly 1 square kilometer) IntelFlows is using the power of IoT Big Data and Sensing Technologies to provide an accurate street-level analysis on air pollution. \n",
      " \n",
      " By installing our devices that monitor air pollution have GSM and GPS on vehicles (mostly public transportation) we are creating a Network of Moving Sensors. The data from these sensors combined with data (Copernicus satellite data data from already available air pollution monitoring stations) IntelFlows is creating heat-maps generating insights and offering an overview of the air pollution status in urban settlements. \n",

South Africa has world's biggest antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme for patients living with HIV and AIDS and there's been a steady increase in the number of patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) requiring chronic therapy. A patient's experience tends to be one of long waiting times typically above 3 hours.

      "Founded in 2005 and based in Aix-en-Provence (France) Supersonic Imagine is a company that specialises in medical imaging. The company designs develops and markets a revolutionary ultrasound platform Aixplorer® which uses UltraFast? technology that can acquire images around 200 times faster than conventional ultrasound systems. In addition to providing exceptional image quality this unique technology is the foundation of several innovations which have changed the paradigm of ultrasound imaging: ShearWave? Elastography (SWE?) Angio PL.U.S ? Planewave UltraSensitive? Imaging and more recently TriVu and Needle PL.US. ShearWave Elastography allows physicians to visualise and analyse the stiffness of tissue in real-time using a reliable reproducible and non-invasive procedure. This is an important parameter in diagnosing potentially malignant lesions or other diseased tissue. As of today over 300 publications have demonstrated the value of SWE in the care of patients with a wide range of diseases. The UltraFast Doppler combines colour flow imaging and pulsed wave Doppler into one simple test providing physicians with the results of both simultaneously therefore enhancing the efficiency. The latest innovation Angio PL.U.S provides a higher level of microvascular imaging through significantly improved colour sensitivity and spatial resolution while maintaining exceptional 2D image quality. SuperSonic Imagine has been granted regulatory clearances for the commercialization of Aixplorer® on the main markets. Since April 2014 the SuperSonic Imagine company has been listed on Euronext symbol: SSI).\n",

Six personnes viennent d’être recrutées et six autres devraient suivre d’ici la fin de l’année. « Nous serons ici 25 à 30 personnes dans quelques années plus des doctorants et post-docs » indique Yann LeCun directeur de l’unité de recherche. Son équipe compte aujourd’hui 45 membres répartis entre le siège de Facebook à Menlo Park (Californie) et New York où le chercheur est également professeur.\n",

      " Un déménagement toujours à Paris est d’ailleurs envisagé pour accompagner la croissance du groupe de recherche.\n",

      " \n",
      " Les premières reposent sur la réalité virtuelle autour du casque créé par la société Oculus VR rachetée par le géant américain en 2014. Un premier modèle devrait sortir au premier trimestre 2016 pour « favoriser les interactions sociales virtuelles » explique Mike Schroepfer le directeur technique de Facebook.\n",

      " Yann LeCun a été lui-même recruté par Facebook fin 2013 pour développer les techniques d’intelligence artificielle dont il a été l’un des pionniers le « deep learning » (ou « apprentissage statistique profond »).\n",
      " \n",
      " Ces concepts servent dans des programmes de reconnaissance vocale de reconnaissance d’images de classification d’objets divers mais aussi de traduction automatique prédiction des effets de médicaments…\n",
      " \n",
      " Ces programmes apprennent grâce à des banques de données connues à classer des objets (sons images vidéos…) inconnus. Parfois appelés réseaux de neurones par analogie avec le fonctionnement cérébral ils adaptent leurs centaines de millions de paramètres pour produire la meilleure réponse possible.\n",
      " \n",
      " Yann LeCun a été parmi ceux qui ont amélioré l’efficacité de ces calculs dans les années 1990 et permis leur déploiement récent. Formé en France à l’Esiee et l’université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie il a ensuite travaillé dans les laboratoires de recherche de l’entreprise américaine AT&T.\n",

      " Dans cette quête le monde académique a du mal à rivaliser avec ces entreprises. Des chercheurs du CNRS de l’Inria ou d’universités sont parmi les dernières recrues des équipes FAIR. Tout comme d’autres sont attirés chez Microsoft Xerox ou le japonais NEC. Or plusieurs de ces jeunes chercheurs étaient aussi visés par des établissements de recherche français.\n",
      " \n",
      " Yann LeCun estime que la France (notamment Paris) offre une concentration rare de talents et de cultures variés en mathématiques et informatique les deux disciplines reines du deep learning. « Nous n’avons pas de mal à les convaincre de nous rejoindre. Ils travailleront avec les meilleurs sur des projets ambitieux et auront les moyens techniques nécessaires » souligne-t-il restant silencieux sur les salaires.\n",
      " \n",
      " « Nous les incitons en outre à collaborer avec d’autres équipes et publier leurs résultats de recherche ». Des partenariats devraient notamment se conclure avec l’Inria.\n",
